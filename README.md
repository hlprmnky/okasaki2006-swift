# okasaki2006-swift
Examples and exercises from Chris Okasaki's _Purely Functional Data Structures_ in Swift

## Running
Open the included Xcode project and run tests

## Why is this an iPhone project and not just a Playground?
I plan to eventually include performance tests that can be run in Instruments, and I'd
like to see them running on hardware
